## Overview
This project involves updating the **Services Section** of a portfolio website to include meaningful text in English. The section highlights the services provided by the portfolio owner in a clear and professional manner.

---

## Solution Approach

### 1. Understanding the Structure
- The **Services Section** uses a Bootstrap grid system with `col-md-4` for three service cards.
- Each card contains a title and placeholder content.

### 2. Content Update
- Placeholder text was replaced with meaningful descriptions of services in English.
- Three services were highlighted:
  - **Web Development**: Focused on creating responsive and user-friendly websites.
  - **App Development**: Highlighted the design and development of mobile applications.
  - **Photography**: Described capturing professional visuals for personal or business needs.

### 3. Bootstrap Classes
- Existing Bootstrap classes like `card`, `h-100`, `border-0`, and `shadow-sm` were retained to maintain the design consistency.
- The `card-title` and `card-text` classes were used for styling the service titles and descriptions.

### 4. Responsiveness
- The `col-md-4` class ensures that the service cards are displayed in a three-column layout on medium to large screens and stack vertically on smaller screens.

## Final Output
The updated **Services Section** now contains:
- A heading: "What I Do For You".
- Three service cards with titles and descriptions written in English.
- A clean and responsive layout that aligns with the overall portfolio design.

## Future Improvements
- Add icons or images to each service card for better visual appeal.
- Include links or buttons for users to learn more about each service.
